      "summary": "Engineering lead for team of 4 on comparative market analysis project, built from scratch a suite of web applications for real estate agents to use to create nice-looking reports that compares their client's property to similar properties. Used React, koa, GraphQL, and Redis and modern patterns for universal rendering, state management and css.  Wrote a web application that all other teams could use for anytime deploys to EKS (kubernetes) as an alternative to the existing monolithic deployment pattern that used cron + ec2.  Built a web application that made it quick and easy for stakeholders to create incidents (on PagerDuty and OpsGenie) for production-level failures in our on-call systems.  GraphQL: Implemented the first production-level GraphQL application in the org and set an example for five other projects that followed in the following months. Advocated for the technology and demonstrated several practical patterns that other teams were able to leverage in the following months in order to bring their applications to production.  Onboarded new ~20 new hires so they could become productive on their first day in the new Seattle office  Reduced logging volume by 2/3rds by finding wasteful instances of logging throughout the organization's codebases. Developed and documented a few novel techniques for detecting wasteful logging.  Ensured that all front-end applications across the org were correctly integrated with DataDog's custom metrics, logging, and APM services.",
